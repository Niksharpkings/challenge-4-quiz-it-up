// User Story
// AS A coding boot camp student
// I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
// SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
// I want the JavaScript to tie in with Index.html only
// Acceptance Criteria
// GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
// WHEN I click the <button id="startQuizButtonId" class="startQuizButton">Start Quiz, GO !</button>
// THEN a timer countdown will starts counting down from 75 seconds and i will be asked the 5 questions in the array of objects in the QuestionVarArray) 
// WHEN I answer a question choose selection correctly?
// THEN I will receive 20 points, 5 seconds added to the clock, and startQuizButton button is replaced with next question button <button id="submitAnswerButtonId" class="submitAnswerButton">Submit Answer</button>
// WHEN I answer a question choose selection incorrectly?
// THEN I will receive 0 points and 5 additional seconds are subtracted to the timers countdown
// WHEN I do not answer a question within the time limit?
// THEN I will receive 0 points and the timer will stop
// WHEN I click the next question "continue" button?
// THEN I will be asked the next question in the array of objects in the QuestionVarArray and the timer will continue counting down
// WHEN the first question is answered?
// THEN Question will be removed and new question will appear and the "Continue" button will be replaced with "Start Quiz, Go !" button
// WHEN the last question is answered?
// THEN the timer will reset to 75 seconds and the questions will be asked again
// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
// THEN the game is over
// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and score

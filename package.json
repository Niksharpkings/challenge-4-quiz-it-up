  "description": "This project implemented many different Javascript and API concepts. Some concepts include timers, creating DOM elements through JS instead of HTML, and saving content to local storage. In addition, I had to understand JS Objects and Arrays in order to push new names and scores as Objects into Arrays and then save these into localStorage. Moreover, I had to use JSON.stringify and JSON.parse methods to save and access the localStorage items.",
